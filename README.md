# Clustering-Photo-Condenser
This project makes use of the concepts of k-means clustering in order to condense the colors in a phot by clustering them and then reconstructing the photo using the clustered colors. The result of this computation is a photo which is condensed by a magnitude near 1 million. This shows how k-means clustering can be used on large datasets.
